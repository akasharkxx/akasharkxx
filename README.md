## Hey, 👋, I'm Akash Jaiswar!

### 🎮 About Me

I'm a **Game Programmer** with **4+ years of experience** specializing in **C++, Unreal Engine, Unity**, and game engine development. I excel at building **gameplay systems, rendering pipelines, and networking features**. My work ranges from optimizing flagship mobile games to crafting custom game frameworks and engines.

Currently, I'm focused on **deepening my C++ expertise** and building a **custom rendering engine**, while continuously exploring **OpenGL, DirectX, and low-level systems**. I thrive on solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of interactive experiences.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming, reading manga, or hitting the gym. 🏋️
